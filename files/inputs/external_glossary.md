## AutoCharge

AutoCharge is a technology that automates the authentication, authorization, and billing for EV charging, in contrast to the typical way of charging an electric vehicle, which requires EV drivers to use an app or an RFID card.

AutoCharge aims to make charging an EV at public charge stations as seamless as possible: drive up to a charge station, plug in, plug out. Here’s briefly how AutoCharge works.

This process is network-specific, meaning the driver needs to do an initial set-up for each charging network they want to use.

AutoCharge attempts to solve the problem of messy charging by attempting to make it even easier than fuelling up an ICE car, for example, because EV drivers don’t need to wait at the register to pay for “fuel.”)

Now that EVs are getting longer ranges and CPs are rising everywhere, range anxiety is declining as the main barrier to mass EV adoption. However, another challenge has taken its place—the charging experience.

Charging any electronic device is as simple as plugging it into the socket, and in theory, charging an EV should be as simple as plugging the charging cable into the vehicle. The reality, however, is that, for the most part, EV charging involves several steps and can be quite a hassle for longer, cross-border trips. Depending on the route, an EV driver may need to download and register with multiple apps for multiple EV charger networks and then manually initiate and stop each charging session.

AutoCharge appeals to charge point operators (CPOs) and electric mobility service providers (eMSPs) because it simplifies EV charging. The result is a better customer experience, increasing the perceived value of the charging network and attracting and retaining more drivers.

This technology is also valuable to charge point manufacturers in that it increases the attractiveness of AutoCharge-enabled charge points to CPOs.

The practical use of AutoCharge is straightforward. An EV driver plugs in their EV without fumbling for apps or RFID cards. It is especially useful on longer journeys, provided all charging stations on the way support this functionality.

Another technology is expected to appear on the market soon that provides even better functionality and goes by the name “Plug and Charge.” It is part of the ISO 15118 protocol, and expectations are that its mass adoption will call into question the need for AutoCharge. The reason is that Plug and Charge provides greater security, although it is more expensive and difficult to implement.
## Bidirectional Charging

Bidirectional charging is a process that enables an electric vehicle to draw power from the grid and feed power back into it. The car is a portable energy storage unit capable of harnessing and supplying electricity as needed.

Bidirectional charging technology extends the functionality of EVs beyond mobility, as demonstrated in:

The significance of bidirectional charging lies in transforming electric vehicles into mobile energy units, contributing to grid stability, and facilitating the integration of renewable energy sources. This technology is essential in the era of smart grids, as it provides a dynamic tool to balance power supply, especially with the unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources.

Bidirectional charging can be very cost-effective, as EV owners can return extra energy to the grid with compensation. This can lower energy expenses, particularly when demand is highest and electricity rates are most expensive.

While bidirectional charging presents numerous advantages, its implementation faces hurdles. One major issue is the scarcity of electric vehicles on the market that are equipped to support bidirectional charging capabilities. This limitation is not just about the vehicles themselves but also extends to the requisite charging infrastructure and specific electrical components, which are costly and not universally standardized or available.

Beyond the technical and financial aspects, regulatory barriers present another complex layer concerning the rules and policies governing energy transactions, especially when consumers begin to contribute electricity back to the grid. This raises questions about tariffs, energy taxation, and grid health and safety regulations.

However, with the continuous advancements in EV technology and a growing emphasis on sustainable practices, bidirectional charging is poised to play a pivotal role in the future of energy consumption, grid management, and transportation.
## Charge Point Installer (CPI)

Charge point installers offer EV charger planning, installation, and maintenance services.

Charge point installers (CPIs), as the name suggests, provide EV charge point installation services. However, the scope of their work has expanded with the ongoing growth of the EV charging industry and now includes a range of related services.

At the core of their business, CPIs deal with the technical implementation of EV charging stations, which can be as straightforward as installing a charger for home use or more complex in cases where an entire network of chargers needs to be installed. Large-scale EV charging operations require surveying potential locations where the charge points can be installed, assessing the grid’s reliability, and other elaborate planning steps before installation begins. Therefore, the scope of services and necessary expertise differs among CPIs depending on the type of use cases that they serve.

Some EV charger installers can act as charge point operators (CPOs). The distinction depends on the extent to which the installer is involved in the charging network. If they only provide installation, then they are only installers. However, if they continue their involvement by providing management and maintenance services, they also take the role of a CPO. The benefit of doing so is that while installing EV chargers is a one-time job, providing CPO services is a recurring revenue stream.

The profitability of charging networks built for commercial purposes depends on factors like location, size, charger type, and required management and maintenance. CPIs are usually the first point of contact for private and business customers looking to install charge points. Hence, this interaction is of the essence when considering that the installation quality directly affects the efficiency and safety of the charging stations.

The EV charging market is growing, and so are the needs and requirements of customers, particularly business customers. They now expect a turnkey EV charging solution, which means the installer provides the customer with a complete charging solution. In other words, customers are now expecting CPIs not only to handle charger installation but also to provide the necessary software and, in some cases, to act as CPOs.

Software has become an integral part of EV charging as it allows a range of features like remote control, monitoring, and troubleshooting of the charging stations. It is common, however, for EV charging manufacturers to only offer a limited software package with their chargers, meaning that CPIs need to source a more robust software solution from a third party.
## CPMS (Charge Point Management System)

A CPMS or Charge Point Management System is a comprehensive cloud-based software solution designed to manage and control various aspects of charging stations remotely.

CPMS helps in monitoring the status of charging points, managing user access, collecting data for billing purposes, optimizing charging schedules, and diagnosing any faults or issues that may arise.

Connecting chargers to a network unlocks a series of benefits, both for the EV driver as well as the maintenance (CPO) or service (eMSP) provider. From the driver’s perspective, the connectivity enables clear insights and more control over charging sessions, while for the maintenance and service provider, it allows for easier performance optimization, remote software updates, and troubleshooting.

A typical CPMS enables key capabilities necessary for effective and profitable network operations.

Best-in-class solutions designed for large-scale operations can also include more sophisticated business management capabilities, such as managing multiple locations, partners, geographies, and jurisdictions.

The CPMS backend is responsible for handling core functionalities, data processing, and business logic that enable the operation and management of charging infrastructure.

An EV-charging driver-facing app helps EV drivers locate chargers and control each charging session from start to finish. Many charging apps offer various charging management tools to help you collect data and insights, manage your energy consumption and costs, and –if available– use smart charging features.

A centralized management software system is essential in effectively controlling charging stations. It brings together the utilization, availability, and revenue data aspects to a central point, allowing managers to analyze various performance metrics and promptly take appropriate measures.

Mis-management of the charging points in a network can lead to lost revenue opportunities, excessive cost of electricity and overhead, and EV driver churn due to unsatisfactory experience with the network.

A CPMS presents a number of competitive advantages to charging point operators (CPOs), such as:
## CPO (Charge Point Operator)

In the context of EV charging, CPO stands for “ Charge Point Operator .” A Charge Point Operator is an entity responsible for building, operating, and maintaining electric vehicle charging infrastructure. A CPO may operate their own EV charging stations or install and maintain them for a third party.

A wide range of entities can serve as Charge Point Operators in the EV charging industry.

Electric utilities may serve as CPOs by deploying and managing EV charging infrastructure as part of their service offerings. Utilities have access to the necessary electrical infrastructure and expertise to install and operate charging stations, and they may offer EV charging services to their customers as an additional service.

Companies specializing in operating charging networks can act as CPOs by deploying and managing charging infrastructure across multiple locations or regions. These charging network operators may offer membership-based access to their charging network, allowing EV drivers to access charging stations at various locations using a single account or payment method.
## Demand Response

Demand response (DR) allows utilities and power grid operators to balance electricity supply and demand during peak use. They do so by incentivizing consumers to reduce or shift their electricity consumption.

Utilities and energy suppliers use DR programs to send so-called DR signals to electricity users. These signals can be based on load or price.

In exchange for participating in DR programs, users can receive financial incentives, such as bill credits or rebates.

Below are some of the many benefits that demand response programs bring to users and utilities. DR may help:

A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) -enabled EV is connected to an OpenADR-enabled charge point. A utility sends a DR signal around 18:00 o’clock—a typical time of peak electricity use. This stops the EV from charging and pulls energy from the EV’s battery, which acts as an energy storage unit. Charging resumes later into the night during low energy demand, while the EV owner receives an incentive for participating in a DR event.
## Destination Charging

Destination charging is the use of public charging stations at places where people spend extended periods of time, such as hotels, restaurants, and shopping malls.

Destination charge points are located at areas that are considered an endpoint, i.e., the final destination of a driver’s trip—stores, malls, hotels, restaurants, airports, etc. This contrasts with en-route charging, which also relates to trips but instead happens between the start and endpoint of a trip, such as DC chargers at highway rest areas.

Making this distinction is especially important for site hosts and businesses in the EV charging industry—charge point operators (CPOs) and electric mobility service providers (eMSPs). Location plays a role in all aspects of having EV charging stations—from planning and installation to operation and setting up charging rates.

As an example of some points of consideration regarding destination charging, these types of networks require more CPs but less power than, say, en-route charging, where rapid chargers are needed. The reason is EV owners tend to spend more time at endpoint destinations, so charging can take up more time than if it needs to be done while on the road. Moreover, installing AC fast chargers is cheaper as an investment and in terms of electricity consumption, as well as less taxing on the grid than rapid DC charge points.

There are several reasons why, according to market analysts, destination charging will become one of the most important, if not the most important, factors of the EV charging infrastructure.
## Dynamic Load Management (DLM)

Dynamic load management (DLM) is an algorithm used in CPMS platforms that optimizes electrical current distribution within a DLM group of chargers operating in the same electrical circuit . By monitoring non-managed power consumption and dynamically adjusting charging station output, DLM ensures efficient energy utilization while preventing grid overload. This approach helps businesses eliminate the need for costly infrastructure upgrades.

DLM works with all OCPP-enabled charging stations. It can be integrated with energy management systems and smart meters for more granular load management. Additional DLM capabilities supported by some advanced CPMS platforms allow to set charging priorities, and favor specific users or charging stations based on predefined criteria, enhancing operational efficiency and user satisfaction. Another advanced option is that operators can configure multi-level DLM to reflect their site’s actual setup, with the algorithm considering the limits of each child circuit and its charge points while distributing available power accordingly, including user or charger priorities.

DLM ensures that the total energy consumption of charging stations remains within site capacity, preventing grid overload. By dynamically adjusting power distribution, it mitigates the risk of electrical failures, ensuring uninterrupted charging operations.

DLM optimizes the utilization of existing electrical infrastructure, reducing the need for costly upgrades while enabling efficient power distribution across multiple charge points.

Unmanaged power allocation among charging stations can lead to inefficiencies and increased wait times. DLM dynamically adjusts power distribution based on real-time demand, ensuring optimal charging performance and improving the overall user experience.

As CPOs scale their charging networks, grid limitations can restrict expansion. DLM enables the deployment of additional charge points within existing capacity constraints, facilitating network growth without exceeding site power limits.

DLM prioritizes charging sessions based on predefined rules, such as time-of-use pricing, user priority levels, or available power. This adaptive approach allows CPOs to optimize energy distribution, manage peak demand, and improve operational efficiency.

DLM can be deployed via hardware-based (local) DLM or software-based (cloud) DLM solutions:

Dynamic Load Management (DLM) is increasingly adopted by businesses to optimize energy distribution across electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, ensuring efficient utilization of existing electrical infrastructure and preventing grid overloads.

## Eichrecht

The Eichrecht Measurement & Calibration Act is part of the German Measurement and Calibration Law (Mess- und Eichgesetz, or MessEG) . This law governs the proper calibration of measuring devices, including those used in EV charging stations. It states that the kWh meter should be visible to the EV consumer to ensure accurate and transparent measurement of electricity consumption. The so-called Eichrecht Act includes regulations for compliance, such as the verification of data storage and transparency for the end consumer.

“Eichrecht” ensures that consumers are charged fairly and accurately for the electricity they consume, particularly in public charging stations for electric vehicles. Compliance with this law is mandatory for operators in Germany who wish to provide charging services. This information should also be accessible via the e-mobility provider (EMP) application.

The “Eichrecht” requirements for EV charging stations came into effect in Germany in April 2019. After this date, all new DC and AC charging stations had to comply with these regulations.

However, there was a transitional period for existing charging stations. The law allowed charging stations that were already in operation before April 2019 to continue operating until April 2023 without meeting the new requirements.
## eMSP

An e-Mobility Service Provider (eMSP) is a company that provides access to EV charging services to electric vehicle drivers through digital platforms or applications. They serve as intermediaries, connecting drivers with charging stations managed by Charge Point Operators (CPOs).

The key requirement to becoming an eMSP is the ability to offer a technology platform that provides users with access to charging networks and the option to manage related payments. eMSPs must assist users with issues such as app navigation, billing, customer support, and charger troubleshooting.

Automotive Companies

These companies already have an existing customer base of EV owners and can provide value-added services by integrating charging access into their vehicle ecosystems.

Energy Companies

Energy providers have the infrastructure and expertise to support EV charging and can leverage their position to offer services like roaming and payments.

Charging Network Operators

CPOs with their networks can also act as eMSPs by providing drivers access to other networks via roaming agreements.

Technology Companies

Tech firms can build platforms and apps that aggregate access to multiple networks, providing services like station discovery, payment, and route planning.

Retail and Hospitality Businesses

These businesses can expand into the eMSP space by using charging as a service to attract EV drivers, turning charging stations into customer touchpoints.

Fleet Management Companies

Fleets rely heavily on reliable charging services, so these companies can offer tailored eMSP solutions for fleet operators.

Public Transport and Shared Mobility Providers

Companies managing shared EV fleets or public transportation systems can act as eMSPs to ensure their vehicles can charge seamlessly.

Startups and Aggregators

New entrants can innovate with apps or software platforms that aggregate access to various networks, offering a simplified user experience.

eMSPs primary role is to act as intermediaries, providing digital platforms that connect EV drivers with charging networks. Unlike Charge Point Operators (CPOs), eMSPs do not own, operate, or maintain the physical charging infrastructure.

They enable drivers to locate charging stations, initiate and complete charging sessions seamlessly, and efficiently manage billing and payment processes. A robust eMSP platform should ensure accessibility to real-time information about station availability, charging costs, and session progress.

Customer satisfaction is a core responsibility of eMSPs, requiring them to offer reliable customer support. This includes troubleshooting issues related to app navigation, billing errors, or charger malfunctions. eMSPs could use roaming agreements to expand the network reach, allowing drivers to access a wider array of charging stations managed by multiple Charge Point Operators (CPOs).

Moreover, in an industry where reliability is crucial, eMSPs must ensure platform scalability and operational efficiency to keep up with the rapidly growing EV adoption rates. By doing so, they contribute significantly to the overall user experience and the broader success of the EV charging ecosystem.

eMSPs use Charge Point Management Systems (CPMS) to manage and optimize their services, ensuring seamless operation and enhanced user experience. A CPMS is a centralized software platform that enables eMSPs to handle the following key use cases:

The eMSP’s role is crucial in enabling EV drivers to access multiple charging stations through a single application. By removing the complexity of individual memberships for each charger network, eMSPs are significantly improving customer experience and boosting efficient infrastructure utilisation. Lastly, eMSPs collect and analyse data on charging habits, station performance, and user preferences. These insights are invaluable for infrastructure planning, station deployment, and optimising the overall charging experience.
## En-Route EV Charging

En-route charging refers to charging electric cars while on the road, which is different from destination charging, which takes place at the end of the trip.

Public EV charging can take many forms, depending on where the chargers are located, who owns and operates them, and where they fit in an EV driver’s itinerary. Broadly speaking, en-route charging is the opposite of destination charging because en-route implies that drivers charge on the way to their destination. Yet, en-route and destination charging solve most needs related to EV charging because, combined, they provide a public charging infrastructure that supports EV owners along their trips.

There’s a difference, however, in the type of chargers needed for either type of charging. En-route charging, because it happens during a trip, requires fast charging speeds like those provided by rapid DC charge points.

Hardly any driver wants to wait hours at a roadside stop to continue their trip. However, providing charge stations capable of charging an EV within, say, 20 minutes or less, is considerably more costly than installing Level 2 chargers—which are the standard choice for destination charging.
## Energy Flexibility

Energy flexibility in the context of EV charging refers to the capability to strategically adjust the timing, rate, and direction of electricity flow during vehicle charging processes in response to external signals or conditions.

This flexibility encompasses the ability to modify charging parameters to align with grid needs, electricity prices, renewable energy availability, or user preferences. This adaptability transforms EVs from passive loads into interactive grid resources.

CPOs can dynamically control power consumption at charging stations, allowing for an increase, decrease, delay, or acceleration of electricity consumption based on grid conditions or market signals.

Several key mechanisms are used to control load management and create flexibility in EV charging infrastructure:

The Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) enables remote control of charging sessions through standardized commands. OCPP 2.0 and newer versions specifically include load management functions that allow operators to dynamically adjust charging rates in response to external signals.

Charging equipment with variable power capabilities can adjust charging rates in real-time, typically between 0-100% of maximum capacity. This allows for fine-grained control rather than simple on/off switching.

In three-phase power systems, advanced chargers can distribute load across phases to optimize grid utilization and prevent localized congestion.

Time-varying electricity rates incentivize charging during preferred periods. These can include:

Formal programs where charging operators receive compensation for adjusting load in response to grid operator requests. These typically use:

Machine learning algorithms forecast vehicle charging needs, grid conditions, and electricity prices to optimize charging schedules in advance.

Multi-level control architectures that coordinate charging across sites while respecting local constraints:

Systems that incorporate driver preferences regarding:

These mechanisms work together to transform static charging infrastructure into dynamic flexibility assets that can respond to grid needs while still meeting driver requirements.
## EV Charging for Apartments

EV charging for apartments refers to charging electric cars at charging stations located on the premises of apartment complexes. It differs from other similar uses, such as home charging, for example, which refers to charging at private single-family homes.

According to data from the US Department of Energy, 80% of charging an electric vehicle happens in a home setting , which can be explained by how much time people typically spend at home. Another reason is that home charging allows EV owners to leave their cars to charge overnight, even at a lower speed, which is more cost-effective than using a public charger. However, maintaining a desired state of charge (SOC) for EV drivers living in apartment buildings can be challenging due to the lack of charging infrastructure at such facilities.

Considering this, for many EV owners living in apartments, relying on public or workplace charging is the only option, which is far from ideal. This explains why increasingly more renters and apartment owners are interested in having a charger installed at their place of residence.

Unlike installing a charger at a single-family home, having one at a residential complex is more complex because building owners and managers have the final say. On the one hand, having charge points increases the value of the building. On the other hand, they are an additional expense and responsibility. These factors depend on whether the charger is for the use of all residents or the private use of a particular resident in cases where homeowners or renters have a personal charger installed at their expense.

With regard to installing charging stations at apartment complexes, a critical point of consideration is the availability and distribution of parking spaces. Does the building even have dedicated parking? Is it shared between all residents, or are there dedicated spots for each resident? Furthermore, the number of residents that will use the charge points will also play a role in the decision by a building owner or manager on whether to install charge points.

Installing EV charging stations at apartment buildings is, first and foremost, a significant benefit for EV owners but is also an added value for the property. Moreover, having EV charge points on the premises of apartment buildings is expected to continue its growth as a deciding factor for prospective homeowners and renters. Additionally, residential complex charge stations are essential in advancing sustainability goals and offsetting at least some of the building’s carbon footprint.

Charging for apartments is also an attractive niche for charge point operators (CPOs) and electric mobility service providers (eMSPs). These businesses can offer building owners and homeowners various management, maintenance, load balancing, billing, and payment processing services.
## EV Payment Terminals

EV payment terminals are devices that are connected to charging stations, allowing EV drivers to pay for charging sessions with bank cards.

EV payment terminals are physical devices that are connected to charge points to allow paying for charging sessions with bank cards and contactless payment methods. Paying on the spot like this is also known as ad-hoc payment , as it differs from paying for charging with a prepaid or postpaid balance. The latter two refer to EV drivers using an app provided by the charge point operator (CPO) or electric mobility service provider (eMSP) where users can fill up a balance, similar to a digital wallet, and pay before or after completing the charging session.

Enabling ad-hoc EV charging payments through terminals is a convenience for drivers as it allows them to pay without fumbling through apps. Considering that a driver may subscribe to several charging networks, each offering an app, it becomes clear why a user may prefer to pay with a card instead.

Contactless and card payments are part of two global trends—for self-service retail experiences and cashless payments.

In addition to that, having payment terminals is now a governmental requirement under certain jurisdictions. This is to improve accessibility to EV charging for everybody, as having an open and accessible charging infrastructure is essential for increasing EV adoption and greenifying the transportation sector.

There could be many reasons why an EV driver might want to pay with a card instead of an app. If, for example, they have forgotten their phone or it’s out of battery, depending solely on an app leaves the driver without a way to use a public charger. There are also less tech-savvy drivers; for them, using a card is a more accessible option. Traveling through a different country is also a potential reason a user may prefer to pull out a bank card and pay for a charging session than download and register with an app just to charge once.

Charge points with payment terminals are simply more convenient for drivers. They simplify paying for a session, thus making the network more attractive and increasing user retention. EV drivers share a common frustration about using public charging networks—the number of apps they need to download, register with and go through if they want to charge with multiple CPOs/eMSPs.

In addition, this means having to maintain several payment balances. While some eMSPs offer a single app to use with different EV charging providers, this still limits the choice for EV drivers to the network of chargers that work with that particular eMSP.

Furthermore, payment terminals offer charge point operators an excellent opportunity to improve their service. After all, there’s no better way to attract more customers and increase user satisfaction than to make charging easier, in this case, by simplifying the payment experience.

The need for better accessibility to charging networks is a topic that also caught the attention of governments. It is now a requirement, particularly in some EU members and US states, for public charge points to be connected to payment terminals. Such regulations aim to make charging an EV as easy as possible, so zero-emission vehicles become a more attractive and preferred mode of transportation in light of meeting global environmental goals.

From a driver’s perspective, using a payment terminal is quite simple, arguably even simpler than paying through an app because all they have to do is swipe their card, and charging will start. There’s more going on in the backend, however.

Upon swiping a bank card or supported contactless payment method such as an NFC-enabled smartphone or a smartwatch, the driver gets a small amount of money in their account “locked up.” This pre-authorization deposit verifies the authenticity of the payment method and ensures that the user has available funds in their account. Once the session is completed, the system will charge the user the remaining amount: (total sum) – (the pre-approved amount). Alternatively, the difference will be unlocked for the driver if the total amount is less than the pre-authorized deposit.

Payment terminals provide great convenience for EV drivers, but processing a single payment involves an entire chain of events involving multiple actors. These include charge point and payment terminal manufacturers, financial institutions like acquiring banks, payment gateways, payment processors, and charge point management system (CPMS) providers. The latter can provide CPOs with more flexibility when setting up prices and pricing groups tailored to specific customer segments.

Another consideration about payment terminals concerns the available options and making the right choice. There are different ways to connect charge points to terminals; each configuration can serve specific uses.

There are three main ways that charge points and payment terminals work together. One option is to install a charge point with an integrated terminal. There’s also the option to add a discrete terminal to a compatible charging station. Finally, there are kiosks—standalone terminals that can connect to multiple charge points.

With so many touchpoints, learning about payment terminals can become confusing. Nevertheless, this is an essential topic for EV charging businesses to consider. Understanding payment terminals is crucial for charging operators, including details about how they work and how to choose the right terminal for any business scenario.
## EV Roaming

EV roaming allows EV drivers to charge at charging stations run by different charge point operators (CPOs) than the driver is subscribed to. This way, EV owners can charge with a single customer account at any charging station that’s a party to a roaming agreement.

CPOs and electric mobility service providers (eMSPs) can work together under an EV roaming agreement to grow and scale their operations by opening up to and reaching a wider net of customers and providing them with better charging service.

The role of a CPO is to manage charging stations, while eMSPs are customer-facing businesses that facilitate access to charge points for EV drivers through mobile apps and web portals. Often CPOs also take on the role of eMSPs as well. In essence, eMSPs make charging networks visible to the public and facilitate the interaction between the charge point and the EV driver.

Another role in the EV charging mix is EV roaming hubs . These organizations connect different CPOs and eMSPs, thereby making it possible for EV drivers to charge at many locations even if they are not subscribed to them.

The benefit that CPOs and eMSPs get from EV roaming is that they can attract EV owners from other networks, provide their own customers with access to a broader choice of charging points, or both. EV owners are likelier to choose a CPO or eMSP that gives them a broader selection of charging stations without registering with multiple providers. Such a benefit is especially attractive for EV owners who travel across regions or internationally.

EV roaming works through bilateral (P2P) agreements between charging providers or through EV roaming hubs such as Gireve and Hubject.

Networks with numerous charging points and a high volume of customers and charging sessions often use direct roaming agreements between charging networks (a.k.a. bilateral, peer-to-peer, or P2P agreements). One of the main reasons is the fees charged by roaming hubs, which can accumulate quickly with large-scale operations. Larger charging operators may also opt for bilateral agreements when it is not practical for them to partner with smaller charging networks. However, P2P agreements can become complex when multiple networks are involved.

On the other hand, EV roaming hubs provide a simple solution for operators to collaborate with multiple other companies, as they only need to establish one agreement—with the hub. Small-scale businesses may be affected by the fees associated with joining roaming hubs. Nonetheless, smaller operators can benefit from the more expansive customer reach and better brand recognition that they gain.

Hubs make EV roaming between multiple operators possible by communication protocols such as:

EV roaming is essential for mass electric vehicle adoption because it addresses one of the main barriers to EV ownership: charging anxiety . Charging anxiety is the fear of not having access to working or reliable charging infrastructure. The term is a “successor” of “range anxiety,” which was commonly used to refer to early EV models with limited range. This is no longer a common concern now that electric cars and batteries have become much more efficient and capable. As far as charging goes, EV roaming gives drivers access to a much wider charging network than what is available through a single-network subscription. This applies to local as well as cross-border trips.

From a business perspective, EV roaming enables CPOs to reach more customers, get more utilization per charge point, and offer ancillary services to users outside of their network. eMSPs, in turn, use EV roaming to offer added-value services to EV drivers by leveraging existing CP networks. Such services are usually presented in the form of apps that give drivers single-point access to charging network locations and other features such as starting/stopping charging sessions, booking charging spots, etc.

EV charging brings many benefits, but it also faces some challenges. For EV roaming to function efficiently, charging stations operated by different CPOs must be interoperable and technically compatible. This involves ensuring compatibility between charging standards, authorization processes, payment methods, and communication protocols. Protocols such as OCPP, OCPI, and OICP are commonly used to tackle these challenges.

Moreover, a fair and transparent pricing structure is necessary for EV roaming to succeed, and this is crucial for both EV drivers and CPOs. Participating businesses must pay due diligence because communicating tariffs over the OCPI protocol can get complicated and lead to calculation errors, resulting in a poor customer experience. EV drivers want to know the exact cost of charging at a station run by a different CPO, whereas CPOs aim to recover their expenses smoothly.

In an ideal case scenario, pricing would be unified across all networks. This would make it easier for EV drivers to compare prices and choose the most affordable option. It would also make it easier for CPOs to manage their pricing and ensure that they are not losing money on EV roaming.
## EV Roaming Network Operator

An EV roaming network operator is a service provider that establishes a network by connecting multiple charge point operators (CPO) and emobility providers (eMSP). This allows EV drivers to use stations across different operators within the network seamlessly.
## ISO 15118

ISO 15118 is an international communication standard for electric vehicles (EVs), charge points (CPs), and charge point management systems (CPMSs). It specifies a secure and reliable way for these devices to exchange authentication and authorization data, charging parameters, and billing information.

ISO 15118-enabled charge points (CPs) allow charge point operators (CPOs) to provide EV drivers with a more seamless and secure charging experience. The protocol makes this possible by establishing a reliable communication environment between the EV, the CP, and the charge point management system (CPMS)—a centralized backend software for managing chargers and charging networks.

In the typical scenario, EV drivers can initiate charging only after authenticating themselves and their car. Upon authenticating through an app, RFID card, or another method, the backend system authorizes or disallows charging depending on preset criteria.

The purpose of this data exchange is for the CPMS to know who’s the driver charging which car, whether the driver is allowed to use this particular charger, and who needs to receive the bill for the session. While authentication and authorization happen in a matter of seconds, the need for drivers to physically authenticate is an added inconvenience.

ISO 15118 makes this process more accessible thanks to the Plug & Charge functionality. As the name implies, with Plug & Charge, EV drivers can simply plug into a CP, and authorization and authentication happen automatically. This works because after initial set-up, the EV stores information about the driver, which is then automatically shared with the CP so charging can begin immediately.

Without bogging into too much detail, a Public Key Infrastructure system manages the information exchange. This secure public-key management system uses hardware, software, and procedural units to acquire, store, and manage sensitive data.

In addition to already discussed functionalities, ISO 15118 enables enhanced charging features such as smart charging and vehicle-to-grid (V2G). The latter allows bi-directional energy exchange between the grid and V2G-compatible EVs. Normally, electricity flows unidirectionally—from the grid to the CP and then to the EV, whereas V2G allows electricity to flow both ways.

When V2G-enabled EVs and CPs connect, the EV can send energy stored in its battery back to the charging station and the electricity grid. This way, the grid can handle higher energy consumption without needing peak demand generation.

The latter refers to power generators that are intermittently activated during peak energy demand. The downside is that, on the one hand, this extra generation increases electricity prices, and on the other hand, it usually means involving unsustainable sources such as coal plants. Utilizing the energy stored in EV batteries lowers or outright eliminates this need and acts as energy storage for excess sustainable energy.

Where EV charging is concerned, smart charging establishes two-way communication between the EV and CP to set charging speeds and schedules. Put simply, the electric car sends data about how much electricity it needs to the CP and by what time. In turn, the CP calculates how much energy it needs to release to the EV to efficiently and effectively meet the required time and state of charge (SOC).

Data security is an essential consideration in EV charging. Data exchange is protected within the EV ecosystem by using cryptographic layers added on top of hardware and software solutions. ISO 15118, on the other hand, has built-in security measures, meaning that ad-hoc data security is unnecessary when using this protocol. It handles data protection on several levels—through authentication, authorization, and data encryption.

ISO 15118 is among the important standards for the ongoing development of the EV charging industry. This communication protocol is a secure, reliable, and internationally recognized instrument compatible with many EV hardware and software solutions and charging speeds. Adding to that is the role this protocol will play as grid-balancing technologies become more widespread.

Here are some practical examples of how ISO 15118 can be used:

The charging station also communicates with a back-end system, which manages the charging infrastructure. The back-end system considers the current grid load and sets the optimal charging rate for the EV.

Based on this information, the charging station and the EV agree on a charging schedule. The charging station may start charging the EV immediately or delay it until the grid is under less utilization. The EV and the charging station continue to communicate throughout the charging process. This allows them to adjust the charging rate as needed, for example, if the grid load changes or the EV’s SOC reaches a certain level.

The EV and the charging station communicate using ISO 15118. The EV sends the charging station its identity data for authorization. The charging station verifies the EV’s identity and approves it for charging. The charging station initiates the charging session without any user interaction.

For this process to work, the EV driver needs to go through an initial set-up process, providing their personal and billing information. This information will then be used for each Plug & Charge-enabled session.
## Multi-Unit Dwelling EV Charging

Multi-unit dwelling EV charging refers to installing, operating, and using charging stations on the premises of multi-family buildings. This, along with single-family home charging, creates the residential charging category.

Building an efficient and widespread EV charging infrastructure is undergoing a significant shift—from something considered only “nice to have” due to the previously low adoption of EVs, electric vehicle charging has quickly become a necessity.

EV charging networks hold the key to building a sustainable future for personal and commercial transport, and multifamily property owners are now called to take an active role in helping create a reliable and accessible EV charging infrastructure.

Data from the US Department of Energy says that 80% of EV charging happens at home . However, not all home charging is created equal because there’s a difference between the needs of EV owners who live in single-family homes and those who live in multifamily housing. The same goes for the managers and owners of these buildings, who need to consider a multitude of technical, financial, and organizational factors before they proceed with installing residential charge points.

While residential charging indeed requires forethought, there are the following benefits to consider:

Where charge point operators (CPOs) and electric mobility service providers (eMSPs) are concerned, both types of charging businesses can extract plenty of value from residential charging. By focusing on multi-unit dwellings, CPOs and eMSPs can access a larger volume of potential customers in a single place compared to going after home charging. For example, eMSPs can provide value by providing EV owners living in multi-unit dwellings with a single interface (e.g., an app) where they can manage their residential charging needs and access public charging networks.

A multifamily housing unit with a parking lot allocates several parking spaces for electric vehicles. The charging stations of these parking spaces are connected to a backend system that automatically identifies, authorizes and charges the correct resident. The charging network can also be available for guests of the building and even publicly accessible.
## OCPI (Open Charge Point Interface)

Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI) is an open protocol, developed to facilitate communication and interoperability between different entities within the electric vehicle (EV) charging ecosystem.

OCPI enables seamless EV roaming and access to charging infrastructure for EV drivers by defining common standards for communication between Charging Point Operators (CPOs), e-Mobility Service Providers (e-MSPs), and other relevant stakeholders.

As an open and community-driven standard, OCPI is developed, maintained, and governed by a community of stakeholders, including industry organizations, technology companies, charging network operators, and other relevant entities.

While there isn’t a single entity or organization that exclusively maintains OCPI, there are several organizations and initiatives involved in its development, promotion, and ongoing maintenance. These include:

Electric Vehicle (EV) roaming, also known as charging roaming, refers to the ability of electric vehicle drivers to access charging infrastructure across multiple charging networks using a single account or payment method. EV roaming enables drivers to charge their vehicles conveniently, regardless of the network operator that owns the charging stations.

OCPI (Open Charge Point Interface) facilitates network-to-network communication and data exchange between different Charging Point Operators (CPOs) and e-Mobility Service Providers (e-MSPs), allowing them to collaborate and offer roaming capabilities to EV drivers.

When an EV driver wants to charge their vehicle at a charging station operated by a CPO other than their home network, OCPI enables the communication between the EV driver’s home network (e-MSP) and the host network (CPO). This communication occurs at a network level, enabling the authentication, authorization, billing, and management of the charging session between the two networks.

In direct OCPI roaming, the communication and data exchange between Charging Point Operators (CPOs) and e-Mobility Service Providers (e-MSPs) occur without the involvement of intermediary platforms or hub networks. The parties enter into individual agreements between each other’s networks.

Hub roaming is also possible via OCPI (Open Charge Point Interface). Hub roaming, sometimes referred to as hub-spoke roaming, extends the concept of roaming beyond individual charging networks to include hub networks that aggregate multiple charging networks.

With hub roaming, you connect once to roam with many, using a hub network as an intermediary to get a single point of access to multiple charging networks for EV drivers.

OCPI standardizes the protocols, data formats, and procedures for network-to-network communication, ensuring interoperability and compatibility between different systems and networks within the EV charging ecosystem.

This enables EV drivers to access charging infrastructure seamlessly across multiple networks using a single account or payment method, enhancing the convenience and accessibility of electric vehicle charging.

Through the implementation of OCPI, CPOs and e-MSPs can collaborate to offer roaming capabilities, enhancing the accessibility and convenience of electric vehicle charging for drivers.
## OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol)

OCPP —Open Charge Point Protocol—is an open-source communication protocol that provides interoperability between electric vehicle (EV) charge points (CP) and charge point management systems (CPMS).

This protocol allows charge point operators (CPOs) to gather data and monitor and control CPs through CPMS remotely. Operators use this protocol to:

Furthermore, OCPP enables the functionality of other industry standards, such as:

OCPP ensures interoperability among the various CPs and CPMSs. This allows CPOs to choose and combine solutions from different vendors and easily switch to other products and suppliers.

The hardware-agnostic nature of this protocol future-proofs businesses by preventing vendor lock-in. Vendor lock-in refers to cases in which businesses depend strictly on a specific equipment provider. Avoiding it is an essential benefit of this protocol as the EV charging landscape innovates and regularly offers new and improved solutions.

Likewise, the resources required by CPOs, as well as their business models, can also change over time. For example, a CPO that starts by operating public charging stations may later expand to home and fleet charging. This would require different hardware, software, and procedures; the OCPP protocol enables the smooth addition of such new business cases.

CPOs can also lower costs and improve cost efficiency with OCPP in some of the following ways:

OCPP enables seamless management of load balancing and smart charging . These are increasingly becoming part of governmental regulations that call for charging networks and EVs to have a way to support the electric grid in times of peak demand. It also means that CPOs will not have to invest in costly grid upgrades if they add more chargers to their networks.

End customers also receive better services thanks to the OCPP protocol because CPOs can provide a greater variety of EV charging stations, payment and billing options, and value-added services related to customer account management.

When an EV driver initiates charging of their vehicle at an OCPP-compliant EV charger, the charge point starts communicating via OCPP with the charge point management system (CPMS). The CPMS can then start, stop, and track the charging session, provide real-time updates, and gather billing and analytics data.

The Open Charge Alliance (OCA) is the organization responsible for the development and improvement of OCPP. OCA’s members are businesses in the electric vehicle charging sector, sharing the goal of encouraging compliance with OCPP standards for both EV hardware and software companies. So far the organization has released the following OCPP versions:

Additional resources about OCPP can help explain how the protocol works, what "functional blocks" are in the context of OCPP, what's different between the available versions of this protocol, and more.
## On-Street EV Charging

On-street charging refers to electric vehicle charging infrastructure located on the street.

Socio-economic and urban characteristics are the main drivers that shape the need for EV charging infrastructure. For example, the make-up of homes is a big influencer on whether a particular area needs an extensive public charging infrastructure or is instead better served by private home chargers. For instance, densely populated urban areas, where people live in residential complexes (multi-family dwellings), have considerably different charging needs than rural areas, where most people live in single-family houses and can easily install a home EV charger for private use.

On-street or curbside charging is important for creating an efficient EV charging infrastructure mix and can greatly benefit EV owners without home chargers. At the same time, building a reliable network of on-street charging for public use faces challenges. These barriers explain why curbside charging needs to catch up in development behind other models like destination and home charging.

Due to its complexity, on-street charging requires the involvement of all stakeholders—EV drivers, charge point manufacturers and operators, installers, city authorities, and urban planners.

Many EV drivers are unable to have home chargers due to not having access to off-street parking or driveway or because they live in multi-unit dwellings that have not yet installed charging stations for residents. This leaves EV drivers with public and semi-public charging as the only viable solutions to maintain a charge, which isn’t ideal.

For all its challenges, curbside EV charging is a promising market for charger manufacturers, charge point operators (CPOs), and electric mobility service providers (eMSPs). Indeed, they can be in the driving seat when it comes to solving on-street shortcomings like the need for a reliable way for EV drivers to find and use public on-street charging. It’s also essential to provide EV owners with valuable information, such as pricing and supported charging plugs, so they don’t drive around the city only to find out on the spot that the charger is too expensive, unavailable, or incompatible with their EV. Adding value to drivers with such contextual information is the area of eMSPs, but all players in the EV market can play important roles and reap benefits from curbside charging.

Indeed, the complexity of on-street charging offers an opportunity for CPOs and installers to differentiate themselves from the competition by providing expertise in building, operating, and maintaining curbside charging infrastructure. At the same time, a point to consider is that curbside charging is more susceptible to damage and vandalism, with all the corresponding maintenance concerns.

On-street charging stations can be installed by the authorities for public use or by private individuals and businesses (after obtaining the appropriate permits).
## OpenADR

OpenADR (Open Automated Demand Response) is a non-proprietary, open, and secure communication standard widely used to automate demand response and manage distributed energy resources (DER) in the energy sector. OpenADR facilitates seamless interaction between utilities, aggregators, and energy users in real time. By enabling efficient communication, it helps balance grid demand, enhances energy efficiency, and supports broader energy management goals in the EV charging and renewable energy ecosystems.

OpenADR is a message exchange protocol between two primary players: VTN and VEN. All communications are between a VTN and one or more VENs.

The Virtual Top Node (VTN) is a central server component used within the Open Automated Demand Response (OpenADR) framework. It operates on the utility or grid operator side, serving as the hub for managing demand response events and interactions with distributed energy resources (DERs). Here’s a detailed look at its functionality:

The Virtual End Node (VEN) is a key entity in the OpenADR framework, residing on the customer or resource side and interacting directly with the Virtual Top Node (VTN). It acts as the endpoint that receives and responds to grid signals for demand response (DR) or distributed energy resource (DER) management. Key functionalities of a VEN include:

OpenADR is crucial for integrating renewable energy, enhancing grid resilience, and supporting advanced energy management strategies. OpenADR does this integration by leveraging  the Demand Response (DR ) programs and Distributed Energy Resources (DER) assets for use cases like the following:

Integrating charging stations with OpenADR allows them to function as demand response assets, enabling utilities and operators to manage electricity demand efficiently. The following outlines the steps to enable charging stations within the OpenADR framework:

Each charging station is individually registered with the OpenADR Virtual Top Node (VTN), which serves as the server responsible for demand response event management. This approach directly links the charging station with the utility or demand response system.

Alternatively, a central server using the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) can act as an intermediary. In this setup:

The OpenADR Alliance was formed in 2010 by industry stakeholders to build on the foundation of technical activities to support the development, testing, and deployment of commercial OpenADR and facilitate its acceleration and widespread adoption.

1. Demand Response (DR)
## OSCP (Open Smart Charging Protocol)

OSCP (Open Smart Charging Protocol) is an open-source protocol through which the charge point management system communicates with the energy management system of the site owner or the Distribution System Operator (DSO) system.

The OSCP establishes the communication between the following players:

For charge point operators, OSCP is implemented to dynamically manage the power load of a network of charging stations. Based on data received via OSCP, such as local grid capacity, current electricity rates, and demand, charge point operators can intelligently decide when and how fast to charge an EV. During high-demand periods, charging may be throttled to maintain grid stability, whereas charging may be accelerated when there is surplus power available.
## Payment gateways

A payment gateway is a software application that securely captures, encrypts, and transmits a customer’s payment data (like credit card details) during an online transaction, facilitating the authorization and transfer of funds between parties, such as EV drivers and EV charging service providers.

Payment gateways are software systems that capture, communicate, and encrypt customer’s payment data. They are not exclusive to the EV industry but are integral to any online transaction involving bank cards or digital wallets. While paying with a bank card, whether at a store’s cash register or online, only takes a blink of an eye, there are about a dozen steps taking place behind the scenes. From the initial capturing of the customer’s payment details to the final confirmation or decline of their payment, a payment gateway operates as a crucial communication bridge. It seamlessly links the customer’s bank with the merchant’s bank, facilitating swift, secure transactions. For charge point operators, payment gateways integrate into their EV charging management systems, playing a crucial role in the transaction process:

The significance of payment gateways lies in their ability to provide a seamless, secure, and efficient financial transaction process between EV drivers and CPOs. They ensure that CPOs can accommodate various payment methods, catering to a broader customer base, and comply with financial security standards, thereby building trust among users.

Another critical aspect of payment gateways is their role in safeguarding sensitive data throughout the payment process. They achieve this security through high levels of encryption that protect information from potential breaches and cyber threats, which is paramount in maintaining customer trust and adheruing to data protection regulations.

Finally, payment gateways facilitate interoperability among various banks and payment service providers (PSPs). This allows CPOs to mix and match the payment processing systems they can use and offer, giving EV drivers the freedom to pay with their preferred payment method.

The entire chain of events around payment processing for EV charging is more complex than say, paying at a supermarket, primarily because the payment action is directly liked to starting and stopping charging sessions. Despite this added complexity, the entire process lasts mere secons allowing EV drivers prompt access and a seamless user experience.

The EV charging market sees a distinction between local payment gateways exclusive to specific countries and global entities like Stripe, known for broader geographical coverage. Local gateways are indispensable for operators looking to establish a presence in particular regions, offering specialized services often at more competitive rates. In contrast, larger providers present expansive coverage but typically at a premium.

The necessity for diverse payment options at charging stations is not merely a matter of convenience for EV drivers. It’s becoming a legislative standard in many regions, including under mandates like the EU’s Payment Services Directive and California’s Pricing Requirements. These regulations emphasize the importance of accessible ad-hoc payment terminals, enabling drivers to bypass the hurdles of pre-registration or app downloads, thus promoting a more inclusive and user-friendly charging infrastructure.
## Private EV Charging

Private charging refers to EV charging with controlled access that is not available to the general public, as is the case with public EV charging .

Private EV chargers are not available to the general public but are only used by the owner or whoever the owner allows to charge. Private charging includes different sub-categories, including residential, workplace, and destination charging. Locations where private charge points (CPs) are installed, vary and include private homes, private parking, office buildings, and any other place where the charger is only accessible for private use.

Some sites may offer both private and public charging. Managing such a combination of uses can be easily done through a charge point management system (CPMS)—a software solution that allows charge point operators (CPOs) to remotely and in a single place monitor and manage the stations within the charging network.

More precisely, the CPMS can control access to chargers based on pre-set criteria like the time of day, electricity rates, and availability of charging spots. There are many more functions that a CPMS can perform, and these solutions are adaptable to user needs. With such software, the charge point owner or operator can set different and customizable tariffs and charging schedules as necessary for public and private charging.

The most typical reason a charger may be private is when EV owners buy a charge point for home use. These tend to be installed in garages or other places on private property, which explains why most owners want to keep their chargers private. Charge points for private homes do not need a CPMS as they can be easily managed with an app.

Businesses can also choose to keep their charging stations private, for example, to make sure that they are always available for the needs of the business and also when the CPs are installed at a controlled access area (e.g., a company’s parking lot that’s closed to the public).

Private EV charging is of significance because it gives 24/7 charging access to EV owners and EV fleets. Public charging infrastructure is already struggling to meet demand in many markets, and so counting only on public charging is unfeasible. In addition to that, unlike private charging, which is always available to the owner, public charging means waiting in line when chargers are not available and also dealing with sometimes unreliable service or out-of-service networks. Adding to that is the inconvenience of having to drive around to find a convenient charging spot.

On the other hand, private charging leaves maintenance and reliability to the owner, meaning they have control over their charging experience. Even with private workplace charging, where the employer/company controls charging, it is still easier to maintain an uninterrupted and quality charging service than to do so on a public scale.

For now, private charging is how most drivers charge, with public charging only accounting for a small but important fraction of overall charging sessions. This explains why private charging is so important from a business perspective for companies in the EV charging industry, like charge point operators (CPOs) and electric mobility service providers (eMSPs)—it offers them an excellent opportunity to serve a sizable portion of the EV charging market. Nonetheless, the prevalence of one type of charging over another is subject to socio-economic, demographic, and other location-specific factors.
## Retail Charging

Retail charging refers to electric vehicle charging at retail locations such as malls, shops, and supermarkets.

It is becoming a common sight for retail store parking lots to have EV chargers installed as it is convenient for EV-driving customers and adds a new revenue stream for retail businesses.

Retail charging refers specifically to charging an electric vehicle at retail locations, and there are specifics to that—mainly about the type of chargers that are suitable for retail sites.

One option is to install Level 2 (fast) chargers. These are the most commonly used chargers overall, as they are quite versatile. Level 2 charge points come in various configurations, support a range of speeds, and are compatible with different plug types either natively or with an adaptor. These types of charging stations are also represented across the entire pricing spectrum, so CP owners have lots of flexibility regarding their budget.

Another option is Level 3, also called “rapid” or “DC” chargers. These charging stations can top up an EV in minutes and even provide a full charge in under an hour.

Their rapid speeds make them ideal for retail sites like supermarkets, where visits last only a short time because EV-driving customers can just plug in their cars, do their shopping, and have a decent state of charge (SOC) by the time they are ready to leave the establishment. However, DC chargers are significantly more expensive than Level 2 charge points, to the point that they may be unfeasible for site hosts and charge point operators (CPOs).

Moreover, the cost of the charger is not the only expense. DC chargers work with a three-phase current. Such a high-powered output naturally means high-powered input, which requires the appropriate electrical installation, which comes with high costs of its own.

Lastly, the high-powered requirements of these chargers are reflected in electricity costs. The supply of so much energy in such a short time is expensive.

In sum, for most retailer charging needs, Level 2 charge points may be just what’s needed. While slower than DC charge stations, fast chargers are considerably more affordable, they are more versatile and rarely require modifications to the electrical network.

For all the challenges mentioned above, retail charging remains integral to the EV charging ecosystem. This is because retail locations are everywhere, making them ideal spots for building a wide EV charging network. Furthermore, the prevalence of retail locations makes this an attractive niche for CPOs and electric mobility service providers (eMSPs).

It is only natural that EV drivers would favor retailers that offer EV charging. Recent advancements in EV technology have eased range anxiety, but now charging anxiety sits in its place. While EVs are getting more reliable even for long-range trips, the charging infrastructure is far from optimal. So, drivers prefer to visit retailers where they can top up their batteries while shopping.

Indeed, this means that retailers can score several points if they offer EV charging. Importantly, it makes their business more attractive to an entire segment of consumers—EV drivers. Retailers can use EV charging to serve their customers and engage drivers who have only come to charge. In either case, it’s an extra revenue stream and one that can easily scale. Equally important is the message that retailers send by installing chargers—it shows the public that the retailer cares about sustainable transportation and the needs of this segment of customers that have chosen zero-emission vehicles.

EV charging businesses can make good use of the retail charging segment. For example, retail stores bring something of great value to charge point operators—strategic locations. Retail establishments, especially large chains, are usually located in strategic high-traffic areas, which is an excellent opportunity for a CPO to scale their business.

CPOs can benefit from the entire customer experience that EV drivers receive while visiting retail stores. As long as these establishments offer quality customer service, the positive experience will transfer to the CPO. Alas, the opposite is also true. Poor customer experience can affect CPOs, even if it is unrelated to charging. This is why it is so essential for CPOs to make sure that they partner with quality retailers and that both parties conscientiously fulfill their duties.

Suppose an EV driver goes out to do their weekly shopping, and they have several options for where to shop. On the way to the store, they realize that their EV needs to be charged up to get back home. Logically, the driver will prefer the location that offers ultra-fast charging stations. In addition to being a customer of the respective site, the EV driver will most likely spend more time on site than usual while waiting for their car to charge to the desired SOC. They are also more likely to become repeat customers if they aren’t already.

As mentioned, having EV chargers that offer top charging speeds comes with some consideration about the grid and the electric bill. Fortunately, there is a solution going by the name of dynamic load management (DLM) or dynamic load balancing. DLM is a technology that intuitively manages energy consumption at a site, alleviating grid pressure. Put simply, a DLM adjusts charging sessions in a way that allows power consumption to remain under a certain threshold.

This means that site hosts can install powerful charging networks without altering or upgrading their electric systems. At the same time, DLM brings more flexibility to CPOs in setting up charging tariffs and allows them to optimize costs and increase revenue.

As far as revenue sharing is concerned, CPOs and site hosts can enter into a variety of agreements. The details of these agreements will inform factors such as pricing structure, revenue sharing model, maintenance responsibilities, using the services of eMSPs, etc. CPOs and site hosts can be different organizations, or a retailer can be the CPO of its chargers.
## Roaming Hub

A Roaming Hub in the EV charging ecosystem acts as an intermediary platform fostering interoperability between multiple charging networks and providers. This is enabled through EV roaming protocols, namely the Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI), the Open InterCharge Protocol (OICP), the Open Clearing House Protocol (OCHP), the eMobility Inter-operation Protocol (eMIP), and custom API.

In the EV charging ecosystem, roaming hubs fulfill a critical role by enabling seamless interoperability between Charge Point Operators (CPOs) and Electro-Mobility Service Providers (eMSPs) . These hubs address the challenge posed by the limited geographic and market reach of individual CPOs, which often operate within specific regions or use cases. In contrast, EV drivers expect a unified charging experience, allowing them to charge their vehicles across different networks without juggling multiple apps or subscriptions.

Roaming hubs not only improve the user experience but also deliver tangible advantages to industry stakeholders:

CPOs and eMSPs can establish a direct peer-to-peer roaming connection through the OCPI protocol.

1. OCPI
## Semi-Public EV Charging

Semi-public charging refers to electric vehicle charging at privately owned but publicly accessible sites, such as shopping malls, sports facilities, restaurants, office buildings, adjacent parking lots, etc.

Semi-public EV charging stations are those found at privately owned establishments open to the public. These can be stores, shopping centers, restaurants, sports facilities, entertainment venues, office buildings, etc. As such, semi-public charge points (CPs) can be counted towards the broader category of destination charging .

These charging stations are called semi-public because, typically, they are only accessible to visitors/patrons and during opening hours as opposed to public charging stations that tend to be accessible to anybody 24/7.

Semi-public chargers may be considered an amenity for customers of the site host, and charging may even be offered for free or as a bonus towards making a purchase at the location.

Offering EV charging makes businesses more attractive to present and potential customers, bringing a competitive advantage over sites that do not have CPs installed. With the rise of EV adoption, places with chargers will become even more attractive and essential to building an EV charging infrastructure that includes a mix of public, semi-public, and private charging networks. Moreover, having charge points on the premises can increase the time customers spend with the business while waiting for their EVs to reach the desired state of charge.

As far as charge point operators (CPOs) and electric mobility service providers (eMSPs) are concerned, both can draw great benefits from semi-public charging. These types of businesses possess the necessary expertise to manage charging networks and make them accessible and attractive to drivers, know-how that site hosts rarely have and would gladly outsource to someone who specializes in this type of service.

The same applies to cases when the site host is not the owner of the charging stations but is renting out space to CPOs to install their charge points. In either case, CPOs and eMSPs gain access to a vast segment of the EV-driving community by having charging stations at semi-public locations.

There could be a symbiotic relationship between the site host and the CPO or eMSP, where the hosting business benefits from attracting EV drivers, while CPOs and eMSPs benefit from the foot traffic generated at the respective location. Something to consider, however, is that the quality and attractiveness of the charging service are also dependent on the customer experience provided by the site host. Poor customer experience can make EV owners avoid the place, including its charging network.

Let’s consider the following case where a CP owner, in this case—the site host, can benefit from both semi-public and public charging. In this example, the site host is an office building parking lot with CPs installed for employees. This on-site charging network is exclusively available to employees free of charge during business hours (say, 8:00 AM – 6:00 PM) and becomes publicly accessible for a fee after the workday is over (6:00 PM – 8:00 AM).
## Smart Charging

Smart EV charging allows charge point operators (CPOs) and electric vehicle (EV) drivers to optimize the EV charging process. This optimization follows preset criteria such as time of day, electricity costs, EV battery state of charge (SOC), etc.
## Turnkey charging solutions

A turnkey charging solution for EV charging stations is a comprehensive, end-to-end service package designed to simplify the deployment and operation of EV charging infrastructure. It provides all necessary components, services, and support required to make an EV charging station operational and customer-ready.

By integrating critical elements such as planning, permitting, hardware provision, construction, installation, software management, and ongoing maintenance into a single offering, turnkey solutions streamline the process for businesses, property owners, and fleet managers. The term “turnkey” highlights the readiness of the solution, allowing customers to focus on initial specifications and strategic decisions without the complexities of managing separate vendors or technical details.

Some companies offering turnkey charging solutions might include all of the following or some of the following services:

Here are some of the most common applications of turnkey charging solutions; however, this list is not exhaustive:
## Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G)

Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) is a bidirectional charging technology that allows electric vehicles (EVs) to send power back to the grid.

The primary role of V2G is to add electric vehicles (EVs) to the grid as distributed energy resources (DER)—especially useful when grids are experiencing peak utilization.

V2G is still not widely adopted, and few EVs support it. Nevertheless, this is expected to be a particularly sought-after feature as mass EV adoption increases energy consumption. The use of V2G is also expected to find a place in the energy distribution mix as the world further shifts towards renewable energy sources.

In essence, this technology enables EV batteries to be used as energy storage units. storing sustainable energy in EV batteries for later use.

Doing so achieves two main purposes—first, it solves one of the significant challenges facing intermittent renewable energy generation. Namely, what to do with excess energy and how to preserve it when intermittent sustainable energy sources (such as solar and wind power) are not producing electricity.

The second purpose of using EV batteries’ capacity is broader and not limited to sustainable energy. That is, EV batteries can be used to help meet peak energy demand and to provide electricity during power outages.

Essentially, V2G is a communication technology. It acts as a bridge between EVs and electric grids, allowing the two to communicate so the grid can draw power from EV batteries as needed. This communication is facilitated through compatible hardware and communication protocols such as OCPP, ISO 15118, and OpenADR (used in demand response programs).

V2G benefits many stakeholders in the EV charging market. It is particularly useful to CPOs, EV owners, energy utilities, and businesses that operate large fleets and other charging use cases characterized by high energy demand fluctuations and peaks.

This technology offers CPOs an additional revenue stream by allowing them to optimize energy-use costs. Also, thanks to V2G, CPOs can have higher utilization of their charging infrastructure without needing to install higher-capacity charging stations, which could be a big investment. Instead, the EVs plugged into the charge points can charge or send energy back into the grid as needed.

Vehicle-to-grid systems benefit the entire electric grid by acting as a buffer for peak energy use. This can have multiple applications, such as “peak shaving,” where utilities use EV battery-stored energy to keep down or “shave” energy peaks.

There are also environmental benefits in that energy producers will have less need to rely on “peaker” energy sources such as those running on fossil fuels.

Summers and winters are traditionally the seasons with the highest energy use because of cooling and heating, and energy demand can get especially high with extreme temperatures. With the help of V2G, EV batteries can be used to offload some of that extra demand exerted over the grid.
## Workplace EV Charging

Workplace charging refers to having EV charging stations on company premises where employees can charge their personal and company electric vehicles.

Workplace EV charging is a broad term encompassing several uses. It can refer to companies that offer EV charging for their employees’ personal EVs. This can be counted as private charging (if only company representatives can access the chargers) or semi-public charging (if the company also gives public access to its charging network). By opening their charging infrastructure to the public, businesses can add a revenue stream to their operations.

Workplace electric vehicle charging can also refer to charging company fleets. However, a distinction must be made based on the fleet’s purpose.

Driving electric vehicles is a growing reality, so providing access to workplace charge points is important to companies seeking to improve employee retention and increase their attractiveness to prospective talent.

Furthermore, for businesses looking to improve their sustainability engagement, having charging stations at the workplace and electrifying company fleets are both significant leaps into showing in practice the company’s commitment to sustainability. This is especially true for businesses operating large fleets, though smaller ones can also benefit from encouraging and embracing zero-emission vehicles.

In many cases, installing workplace charge points won’t be much different than installing a charger at home. Things get more complicated where larger charging networks are needed or a business requires DC fast charging stations.

On the upside, there are charge point operators (CPOs) that specialize in precisely this type of charging, i.e., they have the know-how in designing, installing, and operating workplace EV charging and fleet electrification. Having such expertise can be a considerable competitive advantage as the EV market expands and companies continue to move away from internal combustion engine vehicles and towards electrifying their fleets.

An employee charges their personal EV at a workplace charging station.

Currently, businesses have the excellent opportunity to offer workplace charging by taking advantage of the multiple grants and incentives that encourage companies to electrify their fleets and provide employees with convenient access to charge points.
