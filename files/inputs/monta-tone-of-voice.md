# Monta Tone of Voice Playbook (TOV)

## Introduction

Monta's Tone of Voice (TOV) is how we connect with users — across Hub, Charge, Control, and every communication touchpoint.
This guide goes beyond the Content Style Guide by focusing on **why and how we sound the way we do**, helping writers, designers, and product teams consistently create copy that is clear, human, and motivating.

The Style Guide is the **rulebook** (spelling, terminology, formatting).
This TOV Guide is the **playbook** (strategy, application, and examples).

## How Brand Values Shape Tone

Monta's brand values actively shape how we communicate.
They define our consistency across all channels and products, regardless of audience or scenario.
Monta's voice is **human, bold, confident, and inspiring** — always approachable, never arrogant.

| Brand Value | Tone Impact | Example (Do / Don't) |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Human-Driven Technology** | Approachable and jargon-free — people first, systems second. | **Do:** "Charging paused — here's what to do next."<br>**Don't:** "OCPP handshake error." |
| **Future-Focused Innovation** | Bold, visionary, forward-looking — grounded in reality. | **Do:** "Together, we're building the infrastructure for a cleaner tomorrow."<br>**Don't:** "We will single-handedly revolutionize global energy." |
| **Change Through Collaboration** | Transparent, professional, and collaborative. | **Do:** "Here's how Monta supports your network growth."<br>**Don't:** "Your account settings have been changed." |

## How Voice, Tone, and Personality Work Together

Monta's **Voice**, **Tone**, and **Personality** are three layers of the same system. They make our communication clear, human, and trustworthy across every channel and context.

### Best Practices When Writing

| Step | Principle | Guidance | Example |
|------|------------|-----------|----------|
| **1. Start with Voice** | Voice is constant: human, bold, confident, and inspiring. | Balance technical accuracy and human clarity — never so technical it alienates users, never so simplified it loses precision. | **Do:** "Charger is ready — start a session anytime."<br>**Don't:** "EVSE handshake complete." |
| **2. Check Personality** | Reliable, proactive, innovative yet grounded. | Guides how we sound and feel in every interaction. | **Do:** "We'll guide you step by step — and keep it simple."<br>**Don't:** "Our infrastructure optimization system will seamlessly calibrate protocols." |
| **3. Flex Tone** | Adapt to user's journey and technical literacy. | Tone becomes calmer and more transparent during compliance, billing, or outages. | **Do:** "Payment didn't go through — please check your card details."<br>**Don't:** "Error 104: transaction failed." |

## Tone Across the User Journey

Tone is the emotional color of Monta's communication — how we sound in each moment.
Writers and designers should adjust tone based on:

- **Journey stage:** awareness, onboarding, everyday use, problem resolution, partner communications
- **Technical literacy:** consumer, operator, admin
- **Context sensitivity:** critical vs. routine tasks

### Tone Across the Journey Matrix

| Journey Stage | User Mindset | Tone Guidance | Examples |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Awareness & Exploration** | Curious, evaluating options, low trust | Storytelling-driven, aspirational, energetic — grounded in reality. | **Do:** "Discover how Monta helps businesses scale EV infrastructure with ease."<br>**Don't:** "We're the #1 EV platform, no contest." |
| **Onboarding (First-Time Use)** | Excited but cautious | Supportive, clear, and welcoming. Step-based, not overwhelming. | **Do:** "Let's get your first charging station online — follow these 3 steps."<br>**Don't:** "Setup required before use." |
| **Everyday Use (Active Customers)** | Task-focused, time-sensitive | Direct, efficient, reassuring. | **Do:** "Station online. Session ready to start."<br>**Don't:** "Device status: operational." |
| **Problem Resolution (Errors & Support)** | Frustrated, anxious | Calm, neutral, proactive. | **Do:** "Payment didn't go through — update your card or try again."<br>**Don't:** "Error 104: transaction failed." |
| **Partner & Enterprise Communications** | Strategic, ROI-focused | Professional, collaborative, transparent — approachable. | **Do:** "Here's this quarter's feature updates to improve fleet efficiency."<br>**Don't:** "Your account settings have been changed." |

## Applying Consumer Psychology to Monta's TOV

If tone defines **how we sound**, psychology defines **how we motivate users to act**.
It connects journey stages with behavioral design techniques (Cialdini, Pink) to drive trust, confidence, and conversion.

### Consumer Psychology Matrix

| Journey Stage | User Mindset | Techniques | Examples |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Awareness & Exploration** | Curious but skeptical | Social Proof (logos, testimonials), Authority (data, credentials), Future Vision | **Do:** "Trusted by 300+ energy providers across Europe."<br>**Don't:** "We're the best, trust us." |
| **Onboarding (First-Time Use)** | Motivated but risk-averse | Framing, Commitment & Consistency, Personalization | **Do:** "Step 1: Add your first station — you're halfway to your first charge."<br>**Don't:** "Complete setup to continue." |
| **Everyday Use (Active Customers)** | Confident but time-sensitive | Clarity & Predictability, Positive Reinforcement | **Do:** "Success — tariff updated. Drivers will see new prices in 5 min."<br>**Don't:** "Tariff change processed." |
| **Problem Resolution (Errors & Support)** | Frustrated, anxious | Empathy, Transparency, Solution Framing | **Do:** "We couldn't process your payment — here's how to fix it."<br>**Don't:** "Transaction failed." |
| **Partner & Enterprise** | Analytical, business-driven | Reciprocity, Scarcity/Exclusivity, Social Proof | **Do:** "Join our early access program for advanced load-balancing."<br>**Don't:** "Feature rollout coming soon." |

## Scenario Playbook

Used for sensitive contexts requiring clarity, timing, and transparency.
Ensures **compliance updates**, **billing communications**, and **outage notices** are handled consistently.

| Scenario | Tone & Approach | Example |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Compliance** | Calm, clear, informative. Explain impact and required actions. | "We've updated our privacy policy to meet new EU regulations. Here's what this means for your data." |
| **Billing** | Professional, neutral, transparent. Avoid alarmist language. | "Your invoice for September is now available in Hub. Review and download anytime." |
| **Outages & Incidents** | Empathetic, proactive, provide ETA. | "We're performing scheduled maintenance on 2 Sept, 02:00–04:00. Charging may pause during this time." |

## Best Practices

Copy is a core part of Monta's product experience.
Every message should be purposeful, consistent, and user-centered.

### Checklist

| Step | Action | What to Ask |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Confirm Voice | Does it sound human, bold, confident, inspiring? Do visuals reinforce it? |
| 2 | Filter through Personality | Is it proactive and grounded? Does it reassure without overwhelming? |
| 3 | Flex Tone | Awareness = inspiring, Onboarding = guiding, Everyday = clear, Problem = calm. |
| 4 | Apply UX Principles | Is every word necessary? Does layout guide action clearly? |
| 5 | Verify Accessibility & Consistency | Are terms consistent? Are error states clear, compliant, and paired with helpful copy? |

---

### Examples

**Do:**
- "Charging paused — your cable isn't fully connected. Please reconnect to continue."
- "Welcome! Let's set up your first charging station in three easy steps."
- "Payment didn't go through — please check your card details or try another method."

**Don't:**
- "Session failed."
- "Setup required before use."
- "Error 104: transaction failed."

---

## Quick Reference

- **User literacy:** More context for new users, more precision for technical users.
- **Journey stage:** Inspire early, guide during onboarding, reassure in problem states.
- **Accessibility:** Use plain language, descriptive links, visible form labels, color + text for errors.
- **Consistency:** Use unified terminology (Charger, Charging station, EVSE).
- **Personalization:** Use "you," "your," or names when available.
- **Clarity over hype:** Avoid jargon and overpromising; keep enthusiasm grounded in reality.

---

## Audience-Specific Guidelines

### EV Drivers
- **Tone:** Friendly, encouraging, consumer-focused
- **Complexity:** Minimal technical detail unless necessary
- **Focus:** Quick wins, immediate actions, troubleshooting
- **Language:** Everyday terms, avoid industry jargon

**Example:** "Finding a charge point is easy with the Monta Charge app. Open the map, tap on any green pin, and check if it's available."

### Site Owners
- **Tone:** Professional, business-oriented, ROI-focused
- **Complexity:** Moderate—balance business and technical concepts
- **Focus:** Setup, management, revenue, utilization
- **Language:** Business terms with light technical context

**Example:** "Configure access controls to make your charge points available only to tenants or customers, maximizing utilization while maintaining security."

### Operators
- **Tone:** Technical, professional, comprehensive
- **Complexity:** High—assume technical knowledge, provide detail
- **Focus:** System configuration, integrations, advanced features
- **Language:** Technical terminology, API references, industry standards

**Example:** "Configure OCPP 1.6-J connectivity by entering your charge point's unique identifier and endpoint URL in the Hardware Portal, then verify the WebSocket connection status."

---

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Use Active Voice
Active voice is clearer and more direct than passive voice.

**Good:** "The system sends a webhook when the session completes."
**Avoid:** "A webhook is sent by the system when the session is completed."

### Use Second Person ("You")
Address the reader directly to create engagement and clarity.

**Good:** "You can start a charging session from the mobile app."
**Avoid:** "Users can start charging sessions from the mobile app." or "One can start a charging session..."

### Write in Present Tense
Present tense feels more immediate and actionable.

**Good:** "The API returns a 200 status code on success."
**Avoid:** "The API will return a 200 status code on success."

### Keep Sentences and Paragraphs Short
Break complex ideas into digestible pieces. Aim for 15-25 words per sentence.

**Good:**
"Authentication requires two credentials: a client ID and client secret. You'll receive these after completing partner onboarding. Store them securely."

**Avoid:**
"Authentication, which is required for API access, requires two credentials (a client ID and a client secret) that you'll receive after completing the partner onboarding process, and these should be stored securely in your application."

### Use Lists for Steps and Options
Lists improve scannability and comprehension.

**Good:**
```
To start a charging session:
1. Open the Monta Charge app
2. Select your charge point
3. Tap "Start Charging"
4. Wait for confirmation
```

**Avoid:**
"To start a charging session, open the Monta Charge app, select your charge point, tap Start Charging, and wait for confirmation."

### Front-Load Important Information
Put the most important information at the beginning of sentences and paragraphs.

**Good:** "Webhook signatures verify request authenticity. All webhook requests include an X-Signature header."
**Avoid:** "All webhook requests include an X-Signature header, which you can use to verify authenticity."

## Technical Writing Standards

### Code Examples
- Always include realistic, runnable examples
- Use consistent formatting and indentation
- Comment code when the purpose isn't obvious
- Show both request and response for API examples

### API Documentation
- Specify HTTP methods, endpoints, and parameters clearly
- Document all required and optional parameters
- Include authentication requirements
- Provide example requests and responses
- Document error codes and their meanings

### Error Messages and Troubleshooting
- Describe what went wrong in plain language
- Explain why it matters
- Provide clear remediation steps
- Link to related documentation when helpful

**Example:**
```
**Error:** "Charge point not found (404)"

**Cause:** The charge point ID doesn't exist or you don't have permission to access it.

**Solution:**
1. Verify the charge point ID is correct
2. Check that your API credentials have access to this charge point
3. Confirm the charge point is active in the portal
```

### Screenshots and Visuals
- Use screenshots sparingly—only when they add value
- Annotate images to highlight key areas
- Keep images up-to-date with current UI
- Provide alt text for accessibility
- See `concepts/images-and-media.md` for detailed guidelines

---

## Formatting Conventions

### Capitalization
- **Product names:** Monta Hub, Monta Charge, Partner API, Public API
- **Features:** Use sentence case (e.g., "price groups" not "Price Groups")
- **UI elements:** Match the exact capitalization in the interface
- **Headings:** Use sentence case (e.g., "Getting started with the Partner API")

### Links
- Use descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Link to specific sections when possible
- Reference official API docs with full URLs

**Good:** "Learn more about [authentication flows in the Partner API](https://docs.partner-api.monta.com/authentication)."
**Avoid:** "Click [here](https://docs.partner-api.monta.com) for more information."

### Code and UI References
- Use `backticks` for code, API endpoints, parameters, and file names
- Use **bold** for UI elements users should click or interact with
- Use _italics_ sparingly for emphasis

**Example:** "Click **Settings** in the sidebar, then enter your `clientId` in the **API Credentials** section."

### Numbers and Units
- Spell out one through nine; use numerals for 10+
- Use numerals for technical values (e.g., "3 kWh", "2 API calls")
- Include appropriate units (kWh, kW, minutes, seconds)
- Use commas for thousands (e.g., "1,000 charge points")

## Things to Avoid

### ❌ Marketing Speak
This is documentation, not a sales pitch.

**Avoid:** "Our revolutionary AI-powered platform delivers unparalleled charging experiences!"
**Use:** "Monta Hub provides tools to manage charge points, pricing, and user access."

### ❌ Unnecessary Words
Cut filler words that don't add meaning.

**Avoid:** "In order to start a session, you will need to basically just tap the button."
**Use:** "To start a session, tap the button."

### ❌ Assumptions About User Knowledge
Don't assume everyone knows industry terms or has the same context.

**Avoid:** "Configure OCPP as usual."
**Use:** "Configure OCPP 1.6-J connectivity using your charge point's unique identifier."

### ❌ Gendered Pronouns
Use "they/their" or rewrite to avoid pronouns.

**Avoid:** "When a user logs in, he can access his charge points."
**Use:** "When users log in, they can access their charge points." or "After logging in, users can access their charge points."

### ❌ Emojis and Emoticons
Keep documentation professional.

**Avoid:** "That's it! 🎉 You're all set! 😊"
**Use:** "Setup complete. You can now start using the API."
